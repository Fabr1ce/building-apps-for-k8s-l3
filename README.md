# building-apps-for-k8s-l3
This repo creates a docker image for a go app to be used by k8s, it builds and tests the corresponding container.

### The first step here is to build the app locally to test it by doing the following:

1. On the CLI, build the app by running:

		go build -0 sever .

	then to run the built app:

		./server

2. In the browser, go to `localhost:8000`, and the message on line 20 of the main.go file should display: `v0.2 Building Apps For k8s app says Hi`.


### The second step is to build the Docker image and have it ready for when k8s will use it:

1. Build the image using the CLI, replace *name-of-image* with a chosen name:

		docker build -t <name-for-image> .

2. (Optional): Tag image and push it to dockerhub registry, get *image-id* from outputfrom cmd above and *name-for-image* from same cmd above:

		docker tag <image-id> <name-for-image>:0.1

	then push image:

		docker login   # need to have a dockerhub account

		docker push <name-for-image>:0.1

	the new image can be tested by running its container and going to localhost:8000 to check if the log message in main.go is displayed:

		docker run -d --rm -p 127.0.0.1:8000:8000/tcp f<name-for-image>:0.1

	to stop the container/app:

		docker stop <container-id>

That's it! The go app image is created, tested and pushed to a registry where k8s can fetch it later to build pods.

This [repo](https://github.com/Fabr1ce/building-apps-for-k8s-l4-using-Kind) is an example of how this image can be used to build a Kubernetes pod.
